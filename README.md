A simple YouTube video looper

I wanted to indefinitly loop a YouTube video. So I googled, and I got sites like infinitelooper.com which allow this.
However, since I'm in Lebanon, and my Internet connection is very slow and limited, I couldn't afford the luxury of such sites, which embed the video and download everytime.

So I started looking into YouTube Player JS API. And decided to write code which allows me to automatically replay a YouTube vid locally, without going back to the server.

I'll have to do a more formal README, but anyway, that's the story.

Cheers.
